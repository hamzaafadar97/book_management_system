Documentation for Book Management System,
Laravel Backend
Overview
The backend system is built using Laravel and provides authentication and book management functionalities.
The authentication is done using Laravel Sanctum, and the application structure is based on the MVC pattern.

1. Authentication
1.1. AuthController.php

Register Function: Handles user registration by validating the input data (name, email, password).
If successful, a new user is created and a token is generated for them.

Login Function: Validates the email and password provided by users. If valid, a token is returned,
which should be used for subsequent API calls that require authentication.

Logout Function: Revokes the currently authenticated user's token.

1.2. Models/User.php

This model represents a user in the system.
It uses the HasApiTokens trait from Laravel Sanctum to handle token generation.

1.3. config/auth.php

set up to use Sanctum for the API guard.

2. Book Management
2.1. BookController.php

Index Function: Returns a paginated list of books.
Store Function: Creates a new book after validating input data.
Show Function: Returns details of a specified book.
Update Function: Updates the details of a specific book after validating the data.
Destroy Function: Deletes a specified book from storage.

2.2. Models/Book.php

This model represents a book in the system.

2.3. database/migrations/2023_08_13_211638_create_books_table.php

Migration for creating the books table.
Columns include id, title, author, publication_date, description, created_at, and updated_at.

2.4. routes/api.php

Authentication endpoints: /login and /register.
Book-related routes: These are protected by the auth:sanctum middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access them.
These routes are defined using the apiResource method which sets up standard CRUD routes for books.
